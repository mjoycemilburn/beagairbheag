# Beag air Bheag

Beag air Bheag is a BBC radio programme designed to help students of Scottish GÃ idhlig develop their language skills. Much of the material is available varioouly as downloadable podcasts and text tanscripts that can be viewed on the BBC iPlayer. The BeagairBheag Companion provides a way of "curating" this material to make access more convenient and also to provide serious students with way of adding their own notes on the material. It runs locally in a web-browser (eg Chrome) and presents all of the material for a programme in a convenient graphical form. Here's a sample page:



- A sound-player specifically designd for study-needs (eg replay current sound-bite)
- A mechanism for tagging sound-bites with permanent notes
- A coherent view of all of the transcript material for a programme, presented in the context of the sound-bar itself
