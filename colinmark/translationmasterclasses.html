    <!--    Following the pattern established in the desktop version of the AppARch website, bootstrap is
                used to adapt the presentation format to suit screen sizes. On larger screens, the consolidated
                posts are displayed between flanking columns so that they don't look silly. On smaller screens,
                however, where space is at a premium, the posts occupy the whole screen.
        
                The English version of translation exercises is displayed against a green background. Gaelic
                translations are given a grey background. Post headings are highlighted in red -->

                <p>Between 2004 and 2008, Colin Mark, author of the excellent Gaelic-English dictionary,
                    ran a series of of translation classes through the on-line medium of Fòram na
                    Gàidhlig. These provide an entertaining and instructive resource for Gaelic
                    learners.</p>
                <p>The posts in the documents listed below were retrieved from the GAIDHLIG-B archive on
                    https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa. They have been re-formatted
                    to make them easier to read but are otherwise unaltered. Each post is headed by
                    its original title and despatch date.
